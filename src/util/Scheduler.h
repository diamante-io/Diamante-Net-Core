// This class implements a multi-queue scheduler for "actions" (deferred-work
// callbacks that some subsystem wants to run "soon" on the main thread),
// attempting to satisfy a variety of constraints and goals simultaneously:
//
//   0. Non-preemption: We have no ability to preempt actions while they're
//      running so this is a hard constraint, not just a goal.
//
//   1. Serial execution: within a queue, actions must run in the order they are
//      enqueued (or a subsequence thereof, if there are dropped actions) so
//      that clients can use queue-names to sequence logically-sequential
//      actions. Scheduling happens between queues but not within them.
//
//   2. Non-starvation: Everything enqueued (and not dropped) should run
//      eventually and the longer something waits, generally the more likely it
//      is to run.
//
//   3. Fairness: time given to each queue should be roughly equal, over time.
//
//   4. Load-shedding and back-pressure: we want to be able to define a load
//      limit (in terms of worst-case time actions are delayed in the queue)
//      beyond which we consider the system to be "overloaded" and both shed
//      load where we can (dropping non-essential actions) and exert
//      backpressure on our called (eg. by having them throttle IO that
//      ultimately drives queue growth).
//
//   5. Simplicity: clients of the scheduler shouldn't need to adjust a lot of
//      knobs, and the implementation should be as simple as possible and
//      exhibit as fixed a behaviour as possible. We don't want surprises in
//      dynamics.
//
//   6. Non-anticipation: many scheduling algorithms require more information
//      than we have, or are so-called "anticipation" algorithms that need to
//      know (or guess) the size or duration of the next action. We certainly
//      don't know these, and while we _could_ try to estimate them, the
//      algorithms that need anticipation can go wrong if fed bad estimates;
//      we'd prefer a non-anticipation (or "blind") approach that lacks this
//      risk.
//
// Given these goals and constraints, our current best guess is a lightly
// customized algorithm in a family called FB ("foreground-background" or
// "feedback") or LAS ("least attained service") or SET ("shortest elapsed
// time").
//
// For an idea with so many names, the algorithm is utterly simple: each queue
// tracks the accumulated runtime of all actions it has run, and on each step we
// run the next action in the queue with the lowest accumulated runtime (the
// queues themselves are therefore stored in an outer priority queue to enable
// quick retrieval of the next lowest queue).
//
// This has a few interesting properties:
//
//   - A low-frequency action (eg. a ledger close) will usually be scheduled
//     immediately, as it has built up some "credit" in its queue in the form of
//     zero new runtime in the period since its last run, lowering its
//     accumulation relative to other queues.
//
//   - A continuously-rescheduled multipart action (eg. bucket-apply or
//     catchup-replay) will quickly consume any "credit" it might have and be
//     throttled back to an equal time-share with other queues: since it spent a
//     long time on-CPU it will have to wait at least until everyone else has
//     had a similar amount of time before going again.
//
//   - If a very-short-duration action occurs it has little affect on anything
//     else, either its own queue or others, in the relative scheduling order. A
//     queue that's got lots of very-small actions (eg. just issuing a pile of
//     async IOs or writing to in-memory buffers) may run them _all_ before
//     anyone else gets to go, but that's ok precisely because they're very
//     small actions. The scheduler will shift to other queues exactly when a
//     queue uses up a _noticeable amount of time_ relative to others.
//
// This is an old algorithm that was not used for a long time out of fear that
// it would starve long-duration actions; but it's received renewed study in
// recent years based on the observation that such starvation only occurs in
// certain theoretically-tidy but practically-rare distributions of action
// durations, and the distributions that occur in reality behave quite well
// under it.
//
// The customizations we make are minor:
//
//   - We put a floor on the cumulative durations; low cumulative durations
//     represent a form of "credit" that a queue might use in a burst if it were
//     to be suddenly full of ready actions, or continuously-reschedule itself,
//     so we make sure no queue can have less than some (steadily rising) floor.
//
//   - We record the enqueue time and "droppability" of an action, to allow us
//     to measure load level and perform load shedding.

    // This "latency window" serves 3 distinct purposes simultaneously.
    //
    // Theoretically they could be 3 separate knobs but in practice they
    // all seem both related to one another and roughly the same order
    // of magnitude so we use a single number for all 3 presently:
    //
    //  1. The time-delta subtracted from the observed maximum totalService of
    //     any queue in order to calculate a minimum totalSerice "floor", that
    //     we always advance queues' totalService values to when we run
    //     them. One way to think of this is as a latency cap -- the longest we
    //     want to let one queue that's built up a bunch of "credit" by being
    //     lightly-loaded monopolize scheduling if it's suddenly full of work.
    //
    //  2. The maximum duration between an action's enqueue and dequeue times
    //     beyond which we consider the queue "overloaded" and begin providing
    //     backpressure / load-shedding. One way to think of this is "the
    //     longest tolerable response-delay", which if you squint is similar
    //     to the way of thinking about purpose #1 above: a latency cap.
    //
    //  3. The maximum duration a queue can be idle before we forget about it,
    //     reclaiming its memory. This is even more-obviously related to purpose
    //     #1 above: if an idle queue were made runnable after a time greater
    //     than this duration, it'd have its totalService value set to the
    //     totalService floor, just as it would if it were forgotten entirely
