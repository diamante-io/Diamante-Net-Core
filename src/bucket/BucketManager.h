/**
 * BucketManager is responsible for maintaining a collection of Buckets of
 * ledger entries (each sorted, de-duplicated and identified by hash) and,
 * primarily, for holding the BucketList: the distinguished, ordered collection
 * of buckets that are arranged in such a way as to efficiently provide a single
 * canonical hash for the state of all the entries in the ledger.
 *
 * Not every bucket is present in the BucketList at every instant; buckets
 * live in a few transient states while being merged, upload or downloaded
 * from history archives.
 *
 * Every bucket corresponds to a file on disk and the BucketManager owns a
 * directory in which the buckets it's responsible for reside. It locks this
 * directory exclusively while the process is running; only one BucketManager
 * should be attached to a single diretory at a time.
 *
 * Buckets can be created outside the BucketManager's directory -- for example
 * in temporary directories -- and then "adopted" by the BucketManager, moved
 * into its directory and managed by it.
