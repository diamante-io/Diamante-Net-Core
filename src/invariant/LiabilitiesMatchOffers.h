// with the offer book, and to ensure that the balance of accounts and
// trustlines respect the liabilities (and reserve). It is important to note
// that accounts can be below the minimum balance if the minimum balance
// increased since the last time the balance of those accounts decreased.
// Therefore, the Invariant only checks accounts that have had their balance
// decrease or their liabilities increase in the operation.
